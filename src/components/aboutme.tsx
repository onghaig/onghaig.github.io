          My name is Gavin Ong Hai (王海), and I am a sophomore at Yale University
          studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Much of my past
          work has been in material science and chemistry. Currently, I am more
          interested in working on software and hardware development, as well as
          learning about financial markets. I hope you enjoy looking through my
          website!
