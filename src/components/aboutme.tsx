                    My name is Gavin Ong Hai (王海), and I am a sophomore at Yale University studying
                    Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Much of my past work has been in 
                    material science and chemistry. Currently, I am more interested in working on software and hardware development,
                    as well as learning about financial markets. I hope you enjoy looking through my website!
